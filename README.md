# communicare

A community driven application based on NCOA's CAPABLE which allows 
older people to communicate their needs to a group of certified volunteers 
in order to ease their ability to age at home.

Requests may include simple chores which may be harder to do with those with reduced mobility.
(e.g. throwing out garbage, mowing the lawn, preparing food, keep company)

However, they can range up to professional help.
(e.g. medical checkups, physical therapy, carpentry, installing rails)
